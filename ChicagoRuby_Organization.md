Organization
==
The [ChicagoRuby organization chart](http://github.com/chicagoruby/How_ChicagoRuby_Works/raw/master/ChicagoRuby_Organization.png) shows functions, not individuals. Some organizers perform multiple functions, while some functions are so heavy that they require the attention of multiple organizers.
