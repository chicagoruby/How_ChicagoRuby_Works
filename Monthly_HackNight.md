Monthly Hack Nights
==

Hack nights are a great way for our members to get together and try out the stuff we're learning. 

Our hack nights are consistently rated higher than our regular (presentation-style) meetings. Why? Because our members enjoy getting deeply involved in projects and code. Our members enjoy sharing ideas and expertise. What a powerful way to learn.

When our customers like what we do we should do more of the same!

How to set up and run a hack night
----------------------------------

1.  Confirm date, time, and location with host company.  Also check availability of wireless internet service -- you can't do much hacking without it.  Note whether hosts will provide food and drinks.  Check what their deadline is for signups and whether they need full names for building security.

2.  Enter the details of the event in meetup.com as soon as you know the dates so people can plan ahead. Be sure to set the attendee limit to the size of the room and set automatic waiting list on.   Set RSVP limit to the time the hosts gave you.  Switch on 'Email members automatic reminders' and whatever you prefer for 'Email event hosts when members RSVP'. 

3.  Choose a topic.  This can be anything that would be fun for both new and experienced developers.  An interesting gem, a new API, or a programming puzzle are all possibilities.  A list of places to look for ideas is shown at the end of this page.

4.  Enter the details of the event topic in meetup.com at least 8 days in advance to be sure the one week notice from Meetup includes them.  It's even better to get the details into meetup.com two or more weeks in advance.  A short description of the topic to be covered at the top, making it sound like fun, then be sure to say that all levels of Ruby expertise are welcome, including beginners, and list anything that needs to be installed.  Usually just a reminder to bring a laptop with Ruby installed is enough.  Ask people to give their full names in the comments if they're needed for building security.  Mention if the hosts are *not* providing food so people can eat beforehand.

5. Arrive early for the meeting in case anything needs to be set up.  Bring some power strips in case the room doesn't have enough outlets.

6. Usually people should eat the pizza first so you can start the hacking about 30 minutes after meetup start time.

7. To start the hacking, introduce yourself and Chicago Ruby and thank the hosts for the room and pizza.  If the hosts want you to, briefly describe their company, if they're looking to hire Rubyists, and point out their people in the room.  If you're going on to a bar afterwards give the name and address.

8.  Then describe the problem/puzzle/exercise to be done.  It should be open-ended but with enough details so people know where to start.  For example, 'write a program to connect to the maps API and draw a map of Illinois with counties outlined'.  Some people will do that and some will wander off in different directions but that's OK as long as you give them somewhere to start.  Also tell them what they will need as prerequisites such as gem installs and signing up with outside services.

9.  Now pair everyone up.  First find out if you have any complete beginners so you can make sure none of the pairs have two beginners.   Ask for volunteers to pair with the beginners.  For everyone else, pair them up randomly by counting off or handing out playing cards.  Some people will back out of the pairing if they are leaving early or want to observe.  That's OK.  The idea is to try to get everyone shuffled around so they're not pairing with the people they came in with.  Anyone who arrives late can join up with other late-comers or existing pairs as they like.

10.  Let people work for 1.5 - 2 hours and then wrap up.  There's really no specific conclusion other than asking people if they had a good time and/or learned something useful.

11.  Give the hosts a hand cleaning up.

12.  Have a drink with anyone who wants to visit the bar down the street to continue discussions.  (This part is optional.)



Sources of ideas for hack night projects
----------------------------------------

You want something interesting to try that does not depend on any specialized knowledge beyond Ruby.  For example, advanced Rails tricks and techniques are not a good idea since they assume knowledge of Rails and also probably need too much setup work for an evening project.  Think of a project to play a game, try an API, or display something interesting.
